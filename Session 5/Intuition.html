<p> CSS transitions and transforms are a powerful way to enhance and delight
user experiences. <br/>No added library like GSAP or Velocity.js are necessary.<br/>
Neither is JavaScript required. CSS3 animations include properties that are
already built into CSS and are widely supported across all browsers. <br/>Animations
are a great way to provide visual feedback, delightful moments and memorable
interactions. <br/>Remember, animations should enhance the user experience and not
be distracting. <br/>Animations should be consistent with subtle and simple movements.
</p>
<br/><br/><br/>
First, I will cover transitions since transitions act as the foundation of
animations because <br/>they specify the duration of an element changing its state
smoothly over time. <br/>Without a transition this state change would be abrupt and
take effect immediately. <br/>You will want to use transitions when using transforms
in order to produce a smooth and gradual animation.
<br/><br/><br/>
There are four transition properties, but only two are required:<br/>
<br/>
<li> transition-property (required)
<li> transition-duration (required)
<li> transition-timing-function
<li> transition-delay<br/><br/>

The transition-property specifies the property to be transitioned.<br/>
You can apply a transition to an individual property like the border-color<br/>
or to all the properties by specifying all.<br/>
<br/><br/>
element {<br/>
  transition-property: border-color;<br/>
  transition-property: all;<br/>
}<br/>
<br/><br/>
The transition-duration specifies the time span of the transition.<br/>
The duration can be declared as seconds (s) or milliseconds (ms).<br/>
<br/><br/>
element {<br/>
  transition-duration: 0.5s;<br/>
}<br/>
<br/><br/>
The transition-timing-function specifies the speed of the transition over the<br/>
duration. By default the timing is set to ease. Other pre-defined timing-function<br/>
values include linear, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out, step-start, and step-end.<br/>
You can create a custom speed by inserting your own values into a cubic-bezier<br/>
curve. Here is a cubic Bezier playground that can help you visualize what the<br/>
different speed of curves are like.<br/><br/>
<br/>
element {<br/>
  transition-timing-function: ease-in;<br/>
}<br/>
<br/><br/>
STAGE 1 CODE
<br/><br/>

<br/>
The transition-delay specifies when the transition will start.<br/>
By default the transition will start as soon as the state change on the<br/>
element is triggered.<br/>
<br/><br/>
element {<br/>
  transition-delay: 1s;<br/>
}<br/><br/>

You can write each property individually, but the shorthand is recommended since<br/>
it’s faster and cleaner code. When using the shorthand approach, order DOES NOT<br/>
matter unless you have specified a delay. The first time value stated will be the<br/>
duration and the second value will always be the delay.<br/>

STAGE 2 CODE
<br/><br/>
<br/>
Transforms<br/><br/>
Now we’ll be discussing transforms. Here’s where we can really have some fun<br/>
with elements by distorting them and making them zoom across the screen. But of<br/>
course, remember we’re trying to please and entertain our end users rather than<br/>
make them annoyed. Transforms allow us to move or change the appearance of an<br/>
element on a 2D plane. We will want to use transforms with transitions in<br/>
order to produce a smooth animation. They are triggered when an element<br/>
changes state, such as on a hover. Transform-origin is separate from the<br/>
transform property, but can be used in conjunction with it to specify the<br/>
location origin of the transform.<br/>
<br/><br/>
There are four different types of transforms: Rotate, Skew, Scale and Translate<br/>
<br/><br/>
Rotate<br/><br/>
The rotate transform rotates an element clockwise or counterclockwise by a<br/>
specified number of degrees (deg). A positive value (90deg) will rotate the<br/>
element clockwise and a negative value (-100deg) will rotate the element<br/>
counterclockwise.<br/>
<br/><br/>
element {<br/>
  transition: transform 1s ease-in-out;<br/>
}<br/>
element:hover {<br/>
  transform: rotate(90deg);<br/>
  transform: rotate(-30deg);<br/>
}<br/>
<br/><br/>
STAGE 3 CODE<br/>
<br/>
Skew<br/><br/>
The skew transform tilts an element based on values provided on the X and Y axes.<br/>
A positive X value tilts the element left, while a negative X value tilts it right.<br/>
A positive Y value tilts the element down, and a negative Y value tilts it up.<br/>
If an axis isn’t specified and only skew is stated then that is equivalent to skewX.<br/>
Also you can include both X and Y axes to tilt the element’s angles.<br/><br/>
<br/>
element {<br/>
  transition: transform 0.3s ease;<br/>
}<br/><br/>
element:hover {<br/>
  transform: skew(90deg);<br/>
  transform: skewX(90deg);<br/>
  transform: skewY(-50deg);<br/>
  transform: skew(90deg, -50deg);<br/>
}<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
STAGE 4 CODE<br/>
<br/><br/>
Scale<br/>
The scale transform increases or decreases the size of an element.<br/>
A number larger than 1 will increase the size of the element and a<br/>
decimal less than 1 will decrease the size of the element. For example,<br/>
2 would make the element twice its original size, whereas 0.5 would make<br/>
the element half its original size. The size of an element can be scaled by<br/>
the X-axis, Y-axis or both. The shorthand scale() will effect both axes at<br/>
the same time.<br/>
<br/><br/>
element {<br/>
  transition: transform 1s ease;<br/>
}<br/><br/>
element:hover {<br/>
  transform: scaleX(0.5);<br/>
  transform: scaleY(2);<br/>
  transform: scale(0.5);<br/>
  transform: scale(0.5, 2);<br/>
}<br/>
<br/><br/>
STAGE 5 CODE<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
Translate<br/>
The translate transform moves an element right, left, up or down.<br/>
A positive X value moves the element to the right and a negative X<br/>
value moves the element to the left. A positive Y value moves the<br/>
element downwards and a negative Y value moves the element upwards.<br/>
<br/><br/>
element {<br/>
  transition: transform 0.5s linear;<br/>
}<br/><br/>
element:hover {<br/>
  transform: translateX(15px);<br/>
  transform: translateY(50px);<br/>
  transform: translate(15px, -40px);<br/>
}<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
STAGE 6 CODE
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
Combining Multiple Transforms
<br/><br/>
If we want to get really fancy we can even combine multiple transforms.<br/>
But like I have mentioned before, remember to keep animations subtle and<br/>
smooth for the user to have an enjoyable experience.<br/>
